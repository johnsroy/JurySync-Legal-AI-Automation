Our examination did not include such complementary user entity controls and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such complementary user entity controls.Management's ResponsibilitiesGoogle’s management is responsible for its service commitments and system requirements, and for designing, implementing, operating, and monitoring effective controls within the system to provide reasonable assurance that Google’s service commitments and system requirements were achieved. Google's management is also responsible for providing the accompanying assertion about the effectiveness of controls within the system, selecting the trust services categories and associated criteria on which its assertion is based, and having a reasonable basis for its assertion. It is also responsible for:•Identifying the System and describing the boundaries of the System•Identifying the service commitments and system requirements and the risks that would threaten the achievement of the service commitments and service requirements that are the objectives of the System.A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 3Our ResponsibilitiesOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Assertion, based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the AICPA. Those standards require that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management’s assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about management’s assertion, which includes: (1) obtaining an understanding of Google’s relevant security, availability, confidentiality, and privacy policies, processes, and controls, (2) testing and evaluating the operating effectiveness of the controls, and (3) performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the evidence obtained during our examination is sufficient to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Our examination was not conducted for the purpose of evaluating Google’s cybersecurity risk management program. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on its cybersecurity risk management program.Our examination was also not conducted for the purpose of evaluating the performance or integrity of Google’s AI services. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the performance or integrity of Google’s AI services.We are required to be independent of Google and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, as applicable for examination engagements set forth in the Preface: Applicable to All Members and Part 1 – Members in Public Practice of the Code of Professional Conduct established by the AICPA. We have complied with such independence and other ethical requirements and applied the AICPA’s Statements on Quality Control Standards.Inherent limitationsBecause of their nature and inherent limitations, controls may not prevent, or detect and correct, all misstatements that may be considered relevant. Furthermore, the projection of any evaluations of effectiveness to future periods, or conclusions about the suitability of the design of the controls to achieve Google’s service commitments and system requirements, is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, that the degree of compliance with such controls may deteriorate, or that changes made to the System or controls, or the failure to make needed changes to the System or controls, may alter the validity of such evaluations. Examples of inherent limitations of internal controls related to security include (a) vulnerabilities in information technology components as a result of design by their manufacturer or developer; (b) breakdown of internal control at a vendor or business partner; and (c) persistent attackers with the resources to use advanced technical means and sophisticated social engineering techniques specifically targeting the entity
